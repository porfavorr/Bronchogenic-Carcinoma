    This application is a **B.Tech Major Project** aimed at demonstrating the potential of Deep Learning,
    specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in the domain of medical image analysis for cancer detection.
    It provides a platform for classifying images related to Colon and Lung cancers.

    **Core Technologies Employed:**
    -   **Programming Language:** Python
    -   **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow with Keras API
    -   **Data Handling & Scientific Computing:** NumPy, Pandas
    -   **Image Processing:** Pillow (PIL), OpenCV (for backend processing if extended)
    -   **Model Evaluation:** Scikit-learn
    -   **Web Application Framework:** Streamlit

    **Project Objectives:**
    -   To develop and implement CNN models capable of distinguishing between different tissue types
        (e.g., normal, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma) for colon and lung images.
    -   To engineer a modular and maintainable codebase that clearly separates functionalities such as
        data preprocessing, model definition, training procedures, evaluation, and prediction services.
    -   To create an intuitive and interactive web interface that allows users (e.g., students, researchers)
        to easily interact with the trained models by uploading images and receiving predictions.
    -   To serve as a comprehensive learning tool and a demonstrable piece of work for academic evaluation.

    **Dataset Information (Assumed Structure & Type):**
    The models integrated into this system are designed to be trained on datasets of medical images.
    Typically, these would be histology slides or relevant scans, categorized as follows:
    -   **Colon Cancer Dataset:**
        -   `colon_aca`: Images representing Adenocarcinoma of the colon.
        -   `colon_n`: Images representing Normal/Healthy colon tissue.
    -   **Lung Cancer Dataset:**
        -   `lung_aca`: Images representing Adenocarcinoma of the lung.
        -   `lung_n`: Images representing Normal/Healthy lung tissue.
        -   `lung_scc`: Images representing Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the lung.
    *The specific dataset used for training the deployed models should be detailed by the project author(s),
    including sources, image resolutions, and any specific preprocessing steps undertaken beyond the general pipeline.*

    **Model Architectures:**
    The system utilizes custom-designed CNN architectures. There is also a provision in the codebase
    (commented out example) for extending this with transfer learning techniques, employing pre-trained models
    like VGG16, ResNet, or EfficientNet, which could be a future enhancement.
